Hi I'm Dario! Iâ€™m a PhD student in the MathLab group at the International School for Advanced Studies and at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by Prof. Gianluigi Rozza and Prof. Max Welling. My research interests focus on the application of deep learning for solving differential equations. Specifically, I am driven to investigate deep learning methods for unstructured data, unsupervised generative learning for uncertainty quantification, and physical constraints for ML models. If you are interested in the topics, check out also the medium series [Deep Learning 4 Natural Science](https://medium.com/@dariocos99).

Previously, I was a master student at the University of Trieste in Data Science and Scientific Computing, where I graduated with a thesis on Generative Modelling for fluid simulations. My Bachelor was in Physics, where I conducted one research internship at CNR-IOM on simulating the energetics of graphene on different material sources.
